# Testing Guide: Commit Story Feature

## Executive Summary

✅ **PRIMARY BLOCKER FIXED:** SPA routing now works - `/story` returns 200 OK on Vercel
✅ **DEPLOYMENT VERIFIED:** React app loads, API responds with JSON
⚠️ **LOCAL TEST LIMITATION:** Playwright tests fail locally due to edge function limitation

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem
Playwright tests fail when run locally with `npm run dev` (28/34 failures).

### Root Cause
**Vite dev server doesn't execute Vercel Edge Functions** - it serves `api/commit-story.js` as a static JavaScript file instead of running it as a serverless function.

**Evidence:**
- Local API returns `Content-Type: text/javascript` (JS source code)
- Deployment API returns `Content-Type: application/json` (proper JSON response)
- React app can't parse JS source as JSON, causing page to fail rendering

### Why This Happened
Edge Functions are a Vercel platform feature that only run on Vercel infrastructure, not in local Vite dev server.

##Known Limitations

### What Works
- ✅ Vite dev server for UI/component development
- ✅ React routing and navigation
- ✅ CSS and styling
- ✅ Client-side JavaScript

### What Doesn't Work Locally
- ❌ Edge Function execution (`api/commit-story.js`)
- ❌ Vercel KV cache
- ❌ Tests that depend on API data
- ❌ Full end-to-end flows with real API

## Testing Strategies

### Strategy 1: Test Against Vercel Deployments (RECOMMENDED)
**When to use:** Before merging PRs, validating full functionality

```bash
# Get latest deployment URL
vercel ls sailorskills-site --scope sailorskills | head -5

# Run tests against deployment
npx playwright test tests/e2e/verify-deployment.spec.js
```

**Pros:**
- Tests real production environment
- Edge functions work correctly
- Most accurate testing

**Cons:**
- Requires pushing code first
- Slower feedback loop

### Strategy 2: Use Vercel CLI for Local Development
**When to use:** Developing API-dependent features locally

```bash
# Start Vercel dev server (emulates edge functions)
vercel dev --listen 3000

# In another terminal, run tests
npx playwright test
```

**Pros:**
- Edge functions work locally
- Faster than deploying

**Cons:**
- Slower startup than vite
- Requires Vercel CLI configuration
- May need environment variables set up

### Strategy 3: UI-Only Testing with Vite (CURRENT DEFAULT)
**When to use:** Developing UI, styling, client-side logic

```bash
# Start vite dev server
npm run dev

# Tests will run but API-dependent tests will fail
# This is EXPECTED and OK for UI work
```

**Pros:**
- Fast hot-reload
- Good for UI iteration

**Cons:**
- API tests will fail
- Can't test full user flows

## Test Results Summary

### Deployment Tests (Strategy 1)
```bash
# Tests against https://sailorskills-site-5wc2328kg-sailorskills.vercel.app
✅ /story page loads successfully (2/2 passed)
❌ API returns GitHub 404 error (expected - auth issue, not a blocker)
```

### Local Vite Tests (Strategy 3)
```bash
# Tests against localhost:3000 with npm run dev
❌ 28/34 tests fail
✅ 6/34 tests pass (non-API tests)

Failure reason: Edge function returns JS source instead of JSON
```

## Recommendations

### For This PR
1. ✅ **SPA routing fix is complete and verified**
2. ✅ **Deployment works** - React app loads, API responds
3. ⚠️ **API returns GitHub 404** - needs environment variable check (separate issue)
4. **RECOMMENDATION: Merge PR** - primary blocker resolved

### For Future Development
1. **Add environment variable check** to Vercel deployment for GITHUB_TOKEN
2. **Create mock API data** for local testing (optional enhancement)
3. **Add deployment test step** to CI/CD pipeline
4. **Document API setup** in README for new developers

## Verification Checklist

Before merging, verify:
- [x] `/story` route returns 200 OK (not 404)
- [x] React app HTML is served on deployment
- [x] API endpoint responds with JSON format
- [ ] "OUR STORY" link in navigation (not tested - manual verification needed)
- [ ] Mobile responsive (not tested - manual verification needed)

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Check latest deployment
vercel ls sailorskills-site --scope sailorskills | head -5

# Test deployment URL directly
curl -I https://[deployment-url]/story

# Test API endpoint
curl https://[deployment-url]/api/commit-story

# Run deployment verification tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/verify-deployment.spec.js --reporter=line

# Start local dev (UI only)
npm run dev

# Start Vercel dev (with edge functions)
vercel dev --listen 3000
```

## Environment Variables Needed

For API to work properly on Vercel:
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - GitHub personal access token
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Google Gemini AI API key
- `GITHUB_ORG` - GitHub organization (default: standardhuman)
- `GITHUB_REPO` - Repository name (default: sailorskills-repos)

Check these are set in Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/sailorskills/sailorskills-site/settings/environment-variables

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tests fail locally with "text/javascript" error
**Cause:** Vite doesn't run edge functions
**Solution:** Use Strategy 1 (test deployment) or Strategy 2 (vercel dev)

### Issue: API returns 404/401 on deployment
**Cause:** Missing or invalid GitHub token
**Solution:** Check Vercel environment variables

### Issue: Page loads but shows blank
**Cause:** JavaScript error in browser
**Solution:** Check browser console, verify React bundle builds correctly

### Issue: Vercel dev times out
**Cause:** Vercel CLI building project, may need dependencies
**Solution:** Ensure `npm install` complete, increase timeout, or use Strategy 1
