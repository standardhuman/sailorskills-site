6. Click "Create pull request"

---

### STEP 3: Access Preview Deployment

**What Happens:**
- Vercel automatically deploys all pull requests
- Check the PR's "Checks" tab for deployment status
- Look for "Vercel - Preview" check with deployment URL

**Expected Preview URL Pattern:**
```
https://sailorskills-site-git-feature-commit-story-ui-[team-slug].vercel.app/story
```

**Alternative:** Check Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Find the preview deployment

---

### STEP 4: Test Preview Deployment

**Testing Checklist:**

1. **Basic Page Load**
   - [ ] Navigate to preview URL + `/story`
   - [ ] Page displays header "Building SailorSkills: Solving Real Problems for Hull Cleaners"
   - [ ] No JavaScript errors in console

2. **API Functionality**
   - [ ] Open DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
   - [ ] Refresh page
   - [ ] Check `/api/commit-story` request succeeds (200 status)
   - [ ] Response contains `categories` object with commit data

3. **UI Components**
   - [ ] At least one category section visible
   - [ ] Categories show feature counts
   - [ ] Click category header to expand/collapse
   - [ ] Feature cards display with business impact text
   - [ ] Date badges show (e.g., "Added Oct 2025")
   - [ ] "View commit" links present

4. **GitHub Integration**
   - [ ] Click any "View commit" link
   - [ ] Opens GitHub commit page in new tab
   - [ ] URL format: `https://github.com/standardhuman/sailorskills-repos/commit/{sha}`

5. **Mobile Responsiveness**

   - [ ] Header, categories, cards stack properly
   - [ ] Text readable without horizontal scroll

6. **Caching**
   - [ ] First load: Check response header `X-Cache: MISS`
   - [ ] Refresh page: Check response header `X-Cache: HIT`

---

### STEP 5: Run Playwright Tests (Recommended)

**From this directory:**
```bash
cd /Users/brian/app-development/sailorskills-repos/sailorskills-site/.worktrees/commit-story

# Ensure environment variables are set
# (Copy .env.example to .env.local and add real tokens)

# Run commit story tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/commit-story.spec.js

# Or run all tests
npx playwright test
```

**Expected Result:** All 7 commit story tests should pass

---

### STEP 6: Merge to Main (After Testing Passes)

**Option A: Via GitHub (Recommended)**
1. Go to the pull request
2. Click "Merge pull request"
3. Confirm merge

**Option B: Via Command Line**
```bash
cd /Users/brian/app-development/sailorskills-repos/sailorskills-site
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/commit-story-ui
git push origin main
```

---

### STEP 7: Verify Production Deployment
